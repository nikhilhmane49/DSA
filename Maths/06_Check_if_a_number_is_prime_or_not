Check if a number is prime or not


Problem Statement: Given an integer N, check whether it is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself and the total number of divisors is 2.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:N = 2
Output:True
Explanation: 2 is a prime number because it has two divisors: 1 and 2 (the number itself).





#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n=2;
  int count=0;
  
      for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
          
          if(n%i==0){
              count++;
          }
      }
      
if(count==2){
    cout<<"true";
}
else{
    cout<<"false"; 
}
    
   
    return 0;
}
