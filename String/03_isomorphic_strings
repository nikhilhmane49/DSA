isomorphic-strings



Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

                return false; // If different, strings are not isomorphic
            }
